In certain instances, it is also known as a Robinson Crusoe economy.\n",

    "Dwight, a former pilot and KGB agent from the Soviet Union, has transitioned to a livelihood as a freelance airplane photographer following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Over time, he has become a highly regarded photographer specializing in deserted island photography. Dwight was enjoying a state of great happiness, but it would soon take a turn for the worse... One day while flying over the uninhabited island known as Beets Island, Dwight encountered an engine malfunction and had to perform an emergency landing. Fortunately for Dwight, Beets Island lives up to its name. Upon finding 12 beets, Dwight swiftly realizes that he can use them to successfully catch fish. If Dwight consumes all the beets, he won't be able to catch any fish. However, for each beet he uses, he will catch fish corresponding to the square root of the quantity of beets used for fishing. This is all the background we need to set up a Koopmans model.\n",
